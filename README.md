## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A Gemini API key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))
- MongoDB connection string (if using MongoDB for storing quizzes/attempts)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-quiz-powered-by-ai.git
cd custom-quiz-powered-by-ai
```

2.  Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API keys and environment variables:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# For Google Authentication
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Or your deployment URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate_a_strong_random_secret_here # Use openssl rand -base64 32

# For Database (if applicable)
# MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
*Note: Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a strong, unique secret.*

4.  Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Using the Gemini API

This project uses the Gemini API for:

1.  **Quiz Generation**: Creating questions and options based on user configuration.
2.  **Explanation Generation**: Providing detailed explanations for answers upon request.

The primary interaction logic might be within API routes like `app/api/quiz/generate` and `app/api/explain`.

### API Key Setup

1.  Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
2.  Add it to your `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`.
